My personal website.

To set it up:
- Create a database and execute the SQL requests in /database.sql
- Create a connexion.php file in /includes directory following the model /includes/connexion.sample.php.
- git clone git://github.com/peteboere/css-crush
- Make sure PHP short open tags are enabled
- Make sure you're running through http://foo/ and not through http://foo/bar/
- You're ready!
